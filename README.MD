# The Project AISLE Hate Speech Analyzer

## Introduction

The project AISLE is aimed to develop an automatic hate speech detector in social media posts. This software application analyzes given social media account's posts automatically and produce reports.

It is an effective way of analyzing social media posts. It can read and filter hate speech words much quicker than humans. It goes through one post by one in the given social media account/page.

This project has two main components those are frontend (hate speech analyzer) and backend (management panel). The frontend is responsible for analyzing social media posts automatically, frontend is written in Python. The management panel is the backend for this system. Hate speech keywords, social media accounts/pages, hate speech contexts could be added in the management panel.

This system has manual and automatic processing methods. In the manual processing, the user needs to copy the post contents via pressing CTRL + C, when the contents are copied, they are processed in background to detect hate keywords. In the automatic processing method, no need to have a user to copy the posts' contents, all of the copy and processing works are done by the system itself.
